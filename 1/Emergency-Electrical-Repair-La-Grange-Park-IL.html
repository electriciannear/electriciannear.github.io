The need for surge protectors only became significant in recent years as the trend to go micro also meant the minute devices modern tech and gadgets are more sensitive to surges than the pre-internet age electrical devices. Upon completion of this course, participants should have a basic understanding of electrical troubleshooting techniques used in industry.</p>

<p>Output Volt-Amps (VA) is a measurement of electrical power and is used to size a UPS system for the equipment that will be connected to it.

<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess. While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts.
