<p>Fortunately, you can protect your equipment by simply installing surge protectors where these appliances plug into your wall. When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches. A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>One of the six surge-protected outlets is a transformer outlet designed to accommodate larger power adapters. Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>
<p>Since 1997, Gorman Lightning Protection & Electric has provided electrical products and services in the Santa Fe area, and across the entire state of New Mexico. Having whole house surge protection is important if you want to prevent electric damage that can occur and damage your computer, the other electronics that are connected and the safety of your home.
