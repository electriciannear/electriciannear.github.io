Beginning October 1, 2017, all examinations for state electrical licenses will be based on the 2017 NEC. It's a thin piece of wire designed to carry a limited electrical current. There are different types of electrical lights as well as different types of power sources, such generators, to power important equipment if the power does go out.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.

Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
