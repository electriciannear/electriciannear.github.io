<p>Here's what you need to know to make an informed decision about your Generac home backup generator purchase. Standby generators automatically turn on when the power goes outâ€”you don't have to do a thing. We'll move past the idea that "we are not electrical engineers" and show you how low-voltage lighting has the same design fundamentals as irrigation systems.
