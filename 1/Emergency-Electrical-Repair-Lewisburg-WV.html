The source for the circuit is at the switch and 2-wire cable runs to each receptacle outlet.</p>
<p>When lightning strikes near a building with no protection, it can travel inside via power lines directly connected to the switchboard.

<p>This needs to be enough voltage to continue to operate or power the equipments' needs. Diesel-powered generators - putting aside the price issue - are the most efficient among other types.
