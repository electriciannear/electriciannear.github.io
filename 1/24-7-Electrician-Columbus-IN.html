<h3>Choosing Reliable Columbus IN Electrical Contractors</h3>
<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>Unlike high voltage, Class 1 wiring, Class 2 wiring need not be installed by a licensed electrician. Residential electricians install wiring and troubleshoot electrical problems in peoples' homes, which can be either single-family or multi-family dwellings. Although lighting brings your garden and exterior amenities to life at night time, facade or feature lighting to the exterior of your home should also be considered.
