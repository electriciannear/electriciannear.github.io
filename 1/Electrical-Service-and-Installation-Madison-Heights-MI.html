NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>

While it is true that most people can safely re-wire a plug and there is no need to call an electrician for that one, any tasks more complicated than that, including fitting replacement switches; would be better left to the professional unless you know exactly what you are doing.
