If you've heard your neighbors talking about an electrical panel replacement, you may be wondering if it is something to consider for your home. The generator's power delivery is sufficient to power whole-house loads, including high-wattage units like electric stoves and air conditioning units.</p>
<p>GFCIs prevent electrical accidents by shutting the power off when an electric current is detected to be flowing through the water. If by chance someone plugs an electric heater, or something else into a receptacle outlet and it overloads the circuit, the circuit breaker will trip off. With our product wizard you can select the specifications of your desired lightning and surge protection products, and you will be shown an overview of all matching Weidmüller products.</p>
