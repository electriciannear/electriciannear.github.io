<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>Limited - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show three years of experience supervised by a licensed master or limited electrician. Simply put, this method allows easy troubleshooting and insures proper distribution of power across all lighting fixtures.
