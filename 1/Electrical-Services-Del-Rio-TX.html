<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement.

Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>Installing new light fixtures involves a series of steps like turning off power to the applicable areas of your home, mounting the fixture, and ensuring that the wiring is properly connected.
