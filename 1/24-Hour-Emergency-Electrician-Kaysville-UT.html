While most large generators can power even the largest household appliances, smaller generators may shut down if asked to power high-load appliances such as a washer or refrigerator. As time goes on and you get ready to take your journeyman's test, you will find you need to prove your logged hours on the job, w-4 forms, perhaps even a signed letter from your boss. At this time the users should tighten the loosen nuts and replace the lost, rust and corrosive components.</p>
<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do. You will have to figure out which of the existing switch wires is permanent, and hot and splice into that wire to supply the new switch. Older electrical panels can't always accommodate multiple devices like air conditioners, HDTVs, and clothes dryers running simultaneously. Try to distribute small appliances and electronic devices to several outlets to avoid overwhelming the one.</p>
