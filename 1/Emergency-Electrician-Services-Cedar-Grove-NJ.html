<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>Turn the breaker on to test the outlet and, if it works, turn the breaker off and secure the outlet back into the wall. No, not having a ground on the switch won't make the outlet fail to work.

<p>This popular tester is also used by most inspectors to test for power and check the polarity of circuit wiring. Sometimes, power interruptions could be out of faulty electrical wiring or any disturbances in the power lines, from the generators to the complex system of transformers and outlets. Besides being hazardous, having tangled cables and wires can make it harder to be productive. As a consequence, circuit breakers are slow acting, and often will not trip with a slight trickle of power to ground.</p>
<p>If it immediately trips, the problem is probably in the circuit's wiring; you'll need an electrician. That's why our team of highly-trained electricians are standing by to help. If the continuity check on the load side of the contactor is shorted phase-to-phase, phase-to-ground or open phase-to-phase, then follow the power circuit to the motor. Electrical boxes should be mounted 18” to center off the floor for outlets. If the outlet you're replacing is at the end of the circuit, it wouldn't have the extra pair of black and white wires, since it doesn't need to continue the circuit, so you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and one ground wire in that case.</p>
