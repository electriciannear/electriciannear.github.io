You want to purchase from a dealer that offers delivery, installation, maintenance, and other generator-related services.</p>
<p>Choose this system if you are using new style GE RS series snap-in electrical devices without a strap and wish to mimic the format of the old style Bryant or General Electric wall plates and light switches. Be sure to carefully read the list of all components included with any generator you're thinking about buying, and price a transfer switch separately if it's not part of the package.
