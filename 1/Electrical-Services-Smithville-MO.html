Existing buildings will always need upgrades, repairs and maintenance to electrical systems, while new residences need qualified electricians to install wiring and lighting. The meter and electrical surge suppressors protect from outside electrical interference. Lightning isn't the only thing that can damage your expensive electrical equipment.</p>
