Your Generac home backup generator securely distributes power directly to your home's electrical system. Solution: Check for backstabbed connections by removing a switch or receptacle from its outlet box. For example, one of the most common items added to your electrical system is a ground fault circuit interruptor - or GFCIs for short.</p>
<p>Valuable energy can be saved by converting your existing halogen outdoor lighting system to an LED lighting system, saving you money every month on your energy bill. An electric outlet surge protector is both an affordable and prudent purchase to ensure your electronics are safe and protected from all types of inconsistencies in your electrical system.

You might need to update your breaker box, add a subpanel, or upgrade some of your electrical wiring.
