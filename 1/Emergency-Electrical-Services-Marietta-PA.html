Evaluates electrical systems, products, components, and applications by designing and conducting research programs; Salary 50 Thousand To 1 Lac P.A.</p>
<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
