<p>Electricians often need to move around all day while running wire and connecting fixtures to the wire. Don't go for house generators that huge power output because it won't be of much use. Many states also require a qualifying score on an examination to ensure knowledge of local regulations and the National Electrical Code. Unlike diesel generators there is more maintenance involved in these. I'd give serious consideration to hiring an electrician that will allow you to do lots of the mundane work like nailing up the boxes, running the cables between them, and even allowing you to connect up many of the switches and outlets after the drywall is up. But allow the electrician to do all of the truly complex aspects that only come with years of experience.</p>
