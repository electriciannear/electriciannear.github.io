<p>Electrical testing, load bank testing, fuel, oil and coolant sample testing, infrared testing, and custom outage testing. While it's true that circuit breakers and fuses perform the same general function — which is to short circuit or disrupt overloaded electrical currents — it doesn't mean that they provide the equal amount of protection against electrical hazards in your home. One way you might be able to save money on the upkeep and recurring costs of your system is to use solar-powered lights.</p>
