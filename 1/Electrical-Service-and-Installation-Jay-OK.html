<p>Frequently moving fixtures around can result in damage to the lights themselves. While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose. Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>The panel uses the sun to charge a battery on the lamp, eliminating the need for electrical wires and a transformer. These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family. Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>
<p>Home generators run on diesel, gasoline, propane or natural gas. From arriving on-time, to our friendly and expert service, you'll appreciate quality electrical workmanship in a manner that puts your needs first.

Electrical power generation ( to power starter motors and driving) is essentially a chemical process. Whether your home is already struggling to meet your electrical needs or you are thinking about building an addition or renovating, you will likely need to upgrade your panel to allow for additional circuits.</p>
<p>You now have a better understanding of the basics of the electrical wiring system and how it plays an important roll in the electrical safety of your house. Construction electricians may spend much of their days in outdoor or semi-outdoor loud and dirty work sites. Generac is in a category all their own—they set the gold standard for standby home generators.
