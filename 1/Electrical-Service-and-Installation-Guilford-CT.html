<p>However a number of traditions associated with domestic electrical wiring in the UK still differ significantly from other countries including ring circuits, fused plugs, switch sockets, absence of normal switches and sockets in bathrooms, historic wiring colours and asymmetric supply-voltage tolerances.

Unlike portable generators, there are no smelly by-products of kerosene or gasoline.</p>

Backup generators provide you with full-time power protection. Adding a circuit will avoid a blown breaker and electrical overload.
