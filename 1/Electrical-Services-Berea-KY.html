<p>These landscape lighting fixtures are designed to safely illuminate stairways and walkways. If you smell something fishy (literally), it could be a burning electrical outlet, switch, or other device. The neutral wire in the new switch box is capped with a wire nut unless it's needed for a smart switch or timer. As you add electrical wiring, you'll need another switch to control that part of the home. A surge protective device (SPD) is designed to protect electrical systems and equipment from surge and transient events by limiting transient voltages and diverting surge currents.</p>
<p>Modern generators are more efficient than ever and can create an electrical output that can power your home. With circuit breakers, the breaker will flip off if it cannot handle the amount of electricity that is flowing through it, so you can usually just flip it back on. NEC 411.4(2) does not permit low-voltage lighting systems within 10 feet of these areas, unless permitted by Article 680. With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
