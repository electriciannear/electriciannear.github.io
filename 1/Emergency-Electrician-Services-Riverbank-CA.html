The difference between 2-prong and 3-pronged outlets is that the 3-pronged outlet has a ground.‚Äù Upgrading takes a little more work than just switching the outlet panel. If the lights dim whenever you use a particular outlet, you may be overloading the circuits or wiring. A licensed electrical contractor that is regularly employed by the school system and acting as an employee rather than a contractor while performing regular duties for the school system is not subjected to the examination process and shall be certified as a school maintenance electrician by the NC Department of Insurance upon properly executing and submitting the application for approval.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being ready to respond to any emergency electrical situation that may arise. Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released.
