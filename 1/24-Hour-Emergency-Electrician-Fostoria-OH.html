<p>The diagram above shows a two conductor cable from the circuit breaker panel going to a wall switch. Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present.

The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>The main types of circuit breakers are single pole, double pole, arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCO) and ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI). Generally, the rule is that the generator should be located as close as possible to the fuel supply and transfer switch. In fact the only opportunity for danger when handling or installation is when making the connection to the standard voltage power source or when using a much too small wire size. Electricians passionate about their profession should find numerous opportunities throughout their careers.</p>
