<h3>Purchasing A Standby Generator West Columbia SC 29169</h3>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
<p>At Hall Oil, we can supply either big or small standby generator installations. Of those working for the smallest firms (1-4 employees), 72 percent reported annual company revenues of less than $250,000, while 59 percent of those at firms with 100 or more on staff reported company revenues at $25 million-plus. Under normal use circuit breakers generally last a long time so before you replace a breaker there are often other items that should be checked or inspected first.</p>
