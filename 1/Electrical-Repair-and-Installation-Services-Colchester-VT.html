Some individual low voltage lights can be screwed directly into the deck, be grounded and placed along garden pathways.</p>
<p>However, self-installation and self-repair can be both dangerous and confusing. Because multiple devices (nodes) are connected, the ground potential at different nodes could be different, which can cause ground currents to flow through "the path of least resistance" via either the common earth ground or the ground wire. The modest expense of an emergency electrician is a small price to pay to keep your home and family safe. When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
<p>An electrician will de-energize the circuit, remove the switch, and place individual wire nuts on each of the wires.
