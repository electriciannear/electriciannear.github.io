The generator's power delivery is sufficient to power whole-house loads, including high-wattage units like electric stoves and air conditioning units.</p>
<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits. In the U.S., electrical contracting is an industry valued at over $171 billion annually, made up of over 70,000 electrical contracting firms employing over 650,000 electrical workers.
