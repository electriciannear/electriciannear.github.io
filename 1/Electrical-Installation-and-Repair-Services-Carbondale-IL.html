<h3>Electrical Contractor Duties and Responsibilities in Carbondale IL</h3>
<p>Turn OFF electricity at the main fuse box (or the circuit breaker box) that controls the power to the fixture or the room you're working in. Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‘hot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground. This is especially true if you're using a permanent standby power generator. This generator is fitted with a Vanguard V-Twin OHV engine that allows for easy conversion between liquid propane and natural gas during installation.</p>
