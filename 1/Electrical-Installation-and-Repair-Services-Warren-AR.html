<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for.
