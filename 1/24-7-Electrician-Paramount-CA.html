<p>Examples of accent lighting include track lights and flood lights. Consider decorative lighting such as pendant lights, chandeliers, and wall sconces. Relays only require a momentay pulse of current to change from one state to another - ON to OFF or OFF to ON. These low voltage switches use momentary contact to control the power, so the small-magnitude, low volt current only flows for the length of time that the switch is being pressed. Jasper H. and Phyllis Wyman have lost power dozens of times during the 31 years they've lived in their restored farmhouse in Pittsfield, Maine.</p>
