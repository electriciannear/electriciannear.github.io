Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>Test the lights; if they work correctly, bury the cable. Your family's safety is the utmost important factor to consider when deciding on whether or not to upgrade your home's electrical wiring.
