Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>A common problem is a switch that does nothing or an electrical outlet that is not functional. Experience: Typically, a residential electrician uses single phase power supplies - 120 or 240 volts.
