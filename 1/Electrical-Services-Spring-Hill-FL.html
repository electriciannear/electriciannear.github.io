<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
<p>By installing a circuit breaker sub panel, you make it clear which circuit breakers and branch circuits apply to which parts of the house. 99% of the time this is the reason they will not turn on. If it still doesn't light you have an electrical problem and this should be referred to your local mechanic. You might need to update your breaker box, add a subpanel, or upgrade some of your electrical wiring.
