<p>Moisture can wreak havoc on a home's electrical system and this generally shows at the panels. It is perfectly acceptable to change colors throughout your home, for example satin nickel switches with stainless steel plates in a kitchen, bright red switches on a dramatic accent wall, black outlets in a bathroom with black marble counters or tiling, or pleasing almond electrical wiring devices in a bedroom. Security lighting systems should provide bright light and motion sensors, in consideration of a homeowners' lifestyle.</p>
<p>Businesses that take on electrical projects in multiple states may need to obtain a license in each state where they have a project. Check all the wires in each box, looking for a wire nut that perhaps has come off or should have had another wire in it.

Check and existing light switches and outlets to make sure they work properly.</p>
