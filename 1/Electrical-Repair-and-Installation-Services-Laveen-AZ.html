<h3>How to Protect Your Restaurant Against Power Surges in Laveen AZ</h3>
<p>Frequently moving fixtures around can result in damage to the lights themselves. While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose. Our team of skilled electricians can efficiently repair and rewire your light fixtures and test them for proper functionality so you get bright, efficient lighting without any headaches. Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>
<p>Our training courses prepare maintenance personnel to successfully maintain and repair industrial electrical equipment, improve workforce safety and decrease downtime. Solar path lights are a great way to help reduce your energy usage. The Load terminals (red arrows near the top of our photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the outgoing wires. Even more impressive is the fact that this type of automated system will automatically switch back to the main electrical power supply when it has been restored.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>A standard sized portable generator can use up to 22 gallons of gas or 4-8 20lb tanks of propane per day. You will never have a significant wait time at Turn It On Electric because we send our highly trained experts to sites equipped with all of the necessary parts and tools to fix your issues on the spot. Here are some important safety tips that will keep you and your loved ones safe around the house by preventing electrical hazards. If you are not running the electrical wire more than 80 feet from the electrical panel you can use 12 gauge electrical wires for a 20 amp GFI.</p>
