Homeowners should expect to pay anywhere from $760 to $1,105 for new lighting installation throughout the interior.</p>
<p>Be subtle with LED landscape lighting. Most standby systems come with a digital transfer switch, but you can still request a manual transfer switch. Surge protectors provide you with more electrical outlets as well as protect electrical appliances from surges.
