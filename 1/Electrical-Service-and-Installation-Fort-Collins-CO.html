<p>Electrical contractors may complete many different tasks, in areas that include customer service and administrative work, maintenance, and installation. Smaller portable generators may be enough for a fridge and a few electronics, but larger ones can compete for capacity with mid-range standby generators. By designing your own system, you can pick out different styles and types of lighting such as, spot lights on the house and lower intensity lighting for pathways etc.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows a two conductor cable from the circuit breaker panel going to a wall switch. Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>
