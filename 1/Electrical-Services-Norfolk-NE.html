<p>Due to such safety risks, only copper wiring has been used for electrical systems since the late 1970s. Only to come back 30 minutes later to an error message on the transformer and no working lights. Maintenance electricians repair or replace electric and electronic equipment when it breaks. The Division of Corporation and Professional Licensing staffs the electrical administrator program. Note that when wiring them you'll need to determine which LiteTouch wire is the LED & which is the switch.</p>
<p>To determine which size transformer you need, simply add up the wattage of all the lights in the system. Or, you can show 8,000 hours of experience from outside the state. Choose the wire that goes to the unswitched half of the outlet or, if the entire outlet is switched and there is an extra black in the box that is not being used you might try that one. What ever your goals are it is best to make a plan and design your low voltage outdoor lighting system to achieve your goals.</p>
