<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>
<p>This seems conflicting to our brains though… Usually when we think of a source of electricity being closed,” we start to automatically think that this must be a circuit that is receiving no power. Keep in mind, Passing an exam is required in order to obtain any of these licenses. Some homeowners struggle with effectively wiring new lighting fixtures or accessing their ceiling with a ladder.

Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
