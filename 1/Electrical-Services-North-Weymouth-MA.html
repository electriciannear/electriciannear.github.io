During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>Valuable energy can be saved by converting your existing halogen outdoor lighting system to an LED lighting system, saving you money every month on your energy bill. An electric outlet surge protector is both an affordable and prudent purchase to ensure your electronics are safe and protected from all types of inconsistencies in your electrical system.
