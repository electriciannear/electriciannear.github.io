<p>Switch on the breaker and if the light now comes on, you likely have a bad switch and need to replace it.

Extension cords: There are types of these specifically made for inside or outside. If you're interested in owning the most reliable generator on the block, be sure to contact Guin Service and let us know you're interested in our generator maintenance services.</p>
<p>Upgrading an electrical panel is a serious endeavor that must be handled by a professional; this is not a DIY task. With todays technology, high voltage for landscape lighting is useless. Propane-fueled generators are often smaller than other types, and larger-sized models can be costly to acquire and run. The box with the switch in it thus has a "hot" wire, permanently hot, a neutral and a ground. The location of the switched receptacle is not specified either. We can deliver you the high quality preventative maintenance services you need to have peace of mind in knowing that your home's electrical system is always in the best condition possible.</p>
