You don't just want to go with the first cheap computer surge protector you can find. Low voltage lighting systems usually use LED bulbs because they are energy efficient and draw a small amount of current. However, propane gas or natural gas generators consume more fuel per kilowatt of power produced than diesel generators.</p>
<p>IN choosing these devices, one must remember not to confuse a surge protection strip with an ordinary power strip. These whole house generators are designed to run for longer times using either liquid propane or natural gas. Just use a small electrical device like a drill and check each receptacle using the chosen device. Contact us today for a free landscape lighting consultation by completing the web form to the right.
