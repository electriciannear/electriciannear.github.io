To start, the wiring from the outlet to the switch does not seem to carry the ground over; I can see it terminated at the end of the sheath right where it comes into the light switch box.</p>
<p>Outdoor lighting has the ability to transform even the most ordinary looking spaces into a dramatic area just by highlighting architectural features or landscape, while adding security and even value to your property.
