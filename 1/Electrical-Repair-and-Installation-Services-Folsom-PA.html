<p>One of the first questions I ask a potential client is why they want to upgrade their panel or service. Electricity has made our lives more enjoyable in so many ways- but that doesn't mean it comes without its risks-we'll walk you through some electrical safety tips that all homeowners should be aware of.

Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home.
