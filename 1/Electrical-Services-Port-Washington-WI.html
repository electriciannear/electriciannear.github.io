<p>Low voltage landscape lighting only require a shallow trench, and can even be left above ground, if preferred, though this may put wiring at risk from lawn equipment. You may have difficulty selling your home if you do not have the right electrical safety certificates. However, there is a general understanding within the electrical trade of the standard duties and skills associated with residential electrical installation, upgrades and repair. The correct safety procedures to be used in troubleshooting electrical equipment will be explained in detail.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet. Also think about adding outlets inside bathroom drawers and cabinets to plug in devices like electric toothbrushes, razors, and blow dryers. Call us at (509) 362-9556 to discuss your indoor and outdoor lighting.
