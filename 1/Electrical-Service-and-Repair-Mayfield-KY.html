<h2>Low Voltage Lighting in Mayfield Kentucky</h2>
<p>Each 120-volt circuit has a black or color wire connected to a circuit breaker or fuse; the white wire is connected to the neutral bus bar. For outdoor lights, it is best to choose one that has low wattage to save energy and to avoid lights that are too bright that make your garden look garish and tacky.
