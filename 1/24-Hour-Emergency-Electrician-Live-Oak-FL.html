If the total amount of amps used in that room surpasses 15 amps, the fuse will shut off to keep the outlets and wiring from overheating. Extension cords: There are types of these specifically made for inside or outside.

Copper in electrical wiring does not deteriorate with mere age (contrary to what a New Paltz NY contractor told one of our clients).

Common types of surge protection devices include whole-house, point-of-use and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS).</p>
