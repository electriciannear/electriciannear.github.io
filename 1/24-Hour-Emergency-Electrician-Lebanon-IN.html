<p>Panel upgrades are imperative to the safety and functionality of your home. If you reside in cold climates, you might want to install a natural gas standby system over diesel or gasoline. Replacing or upgrading your breaker box will help to prevent electrical fires in your home, your appliances should work at peak efficiency, and you'll add value to your home. You need an electrical licence before you can do any electrical wiring work in NSW, regardless of the cost of the work and regardless of whether the work is residential, commercial or industrial.</p>
