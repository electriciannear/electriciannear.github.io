<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>Replacing the main circuit breaker costs between $40 to $100 for the part and another $40 to $100 per hour to have an electrician install it. The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.

There are many different light installations that can help enhance the visibility and aesthetics of any room in your house.</p>
