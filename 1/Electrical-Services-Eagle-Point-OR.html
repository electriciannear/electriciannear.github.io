Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>

After completing this course, participants should be able to describe hazards associated with faults and overloads, describe the operation and common types of circuit breakers and fuses, and describe basic procedures for troubleshooting problems with circuit breakers and fuses.
