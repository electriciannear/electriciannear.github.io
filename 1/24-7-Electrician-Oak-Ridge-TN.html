Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs.

If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>By using a larger fuse we may stop the problem of the fuse blowing all the time but the wire is rated to carry only 15 amps. To install a timer simply remove the plug from the outlet, insert the timer into the outlet, then re-plug the transformer into the outlet on the side of the timer. Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where.
