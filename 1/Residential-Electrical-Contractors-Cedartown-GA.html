<p>Standby generators up to 22kW will typically be either natural gas (NG) or liquid propane (LP), but if you're looking for a generator that runs on diesel, you'll need to step up to a liquid-cooled whole-house type that could cost considerably more.

<h2>Whole Home Surge Protection in Cedartown Georgia</h2>
