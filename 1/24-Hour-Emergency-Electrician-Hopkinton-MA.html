<p>As we mentioned earlier, all low-voltage lighting fixtures must be certified by an NRTL to pass inspection. This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
<p>First, connecting the wires leading to downstream outlets with wire connectors creates a more secure connection. Hook the wires onto the new receptacle. We didn't buy a whole-house generator because I didn't want to run out of fuel with an extended power loss. Landscape lighting is also more affordable than ever coming in dozens of styles at a wide range of prices.

<p>So if you are replacing an older, existing switched outlet, and if it has 2-wire cable between the outlet and the switch, then the white wire is being used as either a permanent hot or as the switched power and IS NOT neutral. If your current line can hold 150-amps, you might want to consider that if your budget cannot handle nearly $5,000 for the upgrade to 200-amp service. The licensed electricians of MB Heating & Cooling help you determine the right size generator that is capable of powering you through a utility outage.</p>
