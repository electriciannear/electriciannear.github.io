<p>Standby generators also have solid steel or aluminum enclosures, good mufflers to reduce noise, and be compliant with all relevant emissions regulations. Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>
<p>The brand revamp was done with an aim to establish the company's identity as a one-stop home solutions provider with the next generation customers who make informed buying decisions. Just like the aforementioned remote controlled switches, these are outlets that can be controlled remotely from a device like a smartphone as part of a larger home automation project.
