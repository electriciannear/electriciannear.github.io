The difference between 2-prong and 3-pronged outlets is that the 3-pronged outlet has a ground.” Upgrading takes a little more work than just switching the outlet panel. If the lights dim whenever you use a particular outlet, you may be overloading the circuits or wiring. A licensed electrical contractor that is regularly employed by the school system and acting as an employee rather than a contractor while performing regular duties for the school system is not subjected to the examination process and shall be certified as a school maintenance electrician by the NC Department of Insurance upon properly executing and submitting the application for approval.</p>
<p>Switches typically remain in service for many decades, often being changed only when a portion of a house is rewired.

A common form of electrical panel replacement is upgrading the panel to a larger system or a system that offers more electrical output.</p>
<p>There are various reasons you may want to upgrade your home's electrical panel.
