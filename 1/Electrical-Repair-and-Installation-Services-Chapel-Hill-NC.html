It is also responsible for switching the lights off when the room is empty and turn these on upon sensing the presence of an occupant. A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>
<p>Personalized Service: Our technicians will inspect your home and determine the correct generator needed to power all your appliances and systems. They can be installed in the ground to uplight statues, fountains, flag poles, trees, or your company logo. As long as you take note which wires go to which terminal and copy this arrangement to the new switch, everything should work correctly.

<h2>Holiday Lighting in Chapel Hill North Carolina</h2>
<p>Safety: Allow your residents and visitors to more safely navigate your property at night with a custom outdoor lighting design. Information: This type of lighting can easily be installed by a do-it-yourselfer. Circuit breaker panels are rated by amperage, or amps, as a measure of their electrical capacity. For more information, contact your local or state electrical licensing board. If you want both switches to operate the new lights, use the switched wire as a hot - if not, use the permanent hot as the hot wire.</p>
