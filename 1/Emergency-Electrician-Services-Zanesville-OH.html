<p>This voltage drop is why you're seeing your lights dim. Furthermore, when low voltage fixtures need maintenance, the skill of that labor to understand the system and identify where a transformer that's powering a low voltage fixture is could come at a premium. It is most common to put the red wire on the bottom screw, since that will make the top plug-in "hot" at all times and will be a little easier to plug things into it. A spool of cable is what you see at the home center, and here in the United States it normally will contain two insulated wires and an uninsulated bare copper ground wire.</p>
<p>These switch plates were designed for General Electric's large wide rocker switches and pilot lights know as their RCS series. With just a few years of paid training you can learn to become a licensed electrician and get this career off the ground. If your house is built in the 1960s and has all original electrical panels and wiring, you are within the age threshold where rewiring your home is likely needed. Call today during regular office hours for electrical panel replacement pricing and answers to all of your electrical questions.</p>
