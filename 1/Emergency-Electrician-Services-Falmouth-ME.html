Low voltage landscape lighting systems uses a transformer which lowers the electrical output to the lights. Each receptacle has a 120-volt ‘hot' wire, a neutral wire and a ground. This is especially true if you're using a permanent standby power generator. This generator is fitted with a Vanguard V-Twin OHV engine that allows for easy conversion between liquid propane and natural gas during installation.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet. Also think about adding outlets inside bathroom drawers and cabinets to plug in devices like electric toothbrushes, razors, and blow dryers. Call us at (509) 362-9556 to discuss your indoor and outdoor lighting. The polarity of these wires is not important; either wire on the output side of the transformer may be connected to either wire of the low voltage circuit.
