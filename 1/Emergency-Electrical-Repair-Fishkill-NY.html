<p>GFCI breakers work by sensing differences in electricity that flows into a circuit, caused by contact with humans or water. While there are many different colors and types of materials being used within the solar lights, a flagstone pathway can be nicely illuminated with metal or copper lighting fixtures. However, they require slightly different wiring than a single switch and are a bit more expensive to replace.

The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
