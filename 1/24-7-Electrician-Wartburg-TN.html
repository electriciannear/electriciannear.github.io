<p>Standby generators permanently connect to your home's or business's electrical system. Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers.

Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
