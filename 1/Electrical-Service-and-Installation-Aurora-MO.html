<p>Examples of accent lighting include track lights and flood lights. Consider decorative lighting such as pendant lights, chandeliers, and wall sconces. Relays only require a momentay pulse of current to change from one state to another - ON to OFF or OFF to ON.

<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>Then reconnect the motor starter coil, overload circuit and field wiring, restore incoming power and start the motor. Some of the switches are doubled or tripled together because they power appliances that require large electricity loads, such as air conditioners and electric dryers. When you turn the switch off, it interrupts the electricity that flows through the black wire from the power source to the fixture.
