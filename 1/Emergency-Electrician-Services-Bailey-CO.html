Low voltage landscape lighting helps people find paths and walkways in unfamiliar, dark territory and when installed in overhead features systems light up surfaces used for cooking and serving food, such as BBQs and tables. To be certain that your new wiring adheres to your local electrical codes, have an experienced electrician or electrical contractor perform the installation of any new wiring.
