For help with circuit design and making connections to your main electrical panel, we recommend you consult a licensed electrician. As your service panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, it's critical that it's updated to meet today's energy demands and safety requirements. There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>
