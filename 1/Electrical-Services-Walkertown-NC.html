While most large generators can power even the largest household appliances, smaller generators may shut down if asked to power high-load appliances such as a washer or refrigerator. As time goes on and you get ready to take your journeyman's test, you will find you need to prove your logged hours on the job, w-4 forms, perhaps even a signed letter from your boss.
