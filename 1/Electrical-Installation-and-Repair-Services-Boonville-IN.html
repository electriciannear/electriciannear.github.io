<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>Tightly screw the wires into the new switch. Low voltage landscape lighting helps people find paths and walkways in unfamiliar, dark territory and when installed in overhead features systems light up surfaces used for cooking and serving food, such as BBQs and tables.
