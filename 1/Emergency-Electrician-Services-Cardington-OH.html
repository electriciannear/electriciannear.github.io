The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.” With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off. If you're concerned about protecting equipment while you're away or after office hours, look for surge protectors that completely cut off the power supply after a huge spike.</p>
<p>Surge protectors are also called power strips, surge suppressors and transient suppressors. Make sure the electrician is not only licensed but bonded and insured for the job, as well. But at the closer analysis wrong use or fixing of these electrical wiring causes accidents. We're available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for all your emergency electrical servicing and repairs.
