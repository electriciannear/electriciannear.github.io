<p>Even if you aren't tripping the breakers right now, a 100 amp panel in a modern home is running far too close to capacity to be safe for long term use. We offer a full range of electrical services to keep your home running in top shape. Houses built or rewired more than 30 years ago may have 60- or 100-amp service (amps are a measure of the quantity of electric power). Lay the light fixtures in the approximate spots where they will be installed, and run the cable across the ground from light to light.</p>
