My new switches, like many others, have a green ground wire that was pre-attached at the factory. Most places require documentation of 6,000 to 8,000 hours of apprenticeship, so find out what type of proof your state accepts for those hours. There are many different sizes, types, and brands of generators for both commercial and residential use on the market today.</p>

Electrical boxes should be mounted 18” to center off the floor for outlets. If the outlet you're replacing is at the end of the circuit, it wouldn't have the extra pair of black and white wires, since it doesn't need to continue the circuit, so you'll only have one black wire, one white wire, and one ground wire in that case.</p>
