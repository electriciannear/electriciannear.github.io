Low voltage landscape lighting is used to highlight paths and light up landscape features and buildings. An overload can cause a fire, so it's the job of the electrical panel to break the circuit and regulate the electricity in the system to keep your home and family safe.</p>

<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks. We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>
<p>As you can see, installing low-voltage lighting systems is relatively simple, if a few simple NEC rules are followed. In case you are looking to design or redo your home's lighting, then you might be considering to do this as a Do-It-Yourself project. An automatic standby generator system monitors incoming voltage from the utility power line supplying a home or building with electricity via automatic transfer switch that is integrated into the structures electrical system.</p>
<p>When there is a blackout, a home backup generator will provide enough power. And because the switches are momentary contact, the switch returns to the center after flicking lights on or off. Home standby generators provide homeowners reliable backup power to keep them comfortable, safe, and secure during a power outage. Contact Roby Services today to schedule your Charlotte generator installation or repair appointment. If you are considering upgrading your system, you may want to invest in our breaker and fuse services as well.</p>
