<p>Whether or not you need to add wiring: If you install a light where no wiring exists, the overall cost of the installation project will increase. The test is pretty easy (I mean electricians need to pass this) and costs about $50. First, only 14 (not 12) gauge wires are to be inserted in the "quick-wire" holes available on the back of many receptacles and switches.

Never fight an electrical fire with water— instead, reach for the fire extinguisher or baking soda.
