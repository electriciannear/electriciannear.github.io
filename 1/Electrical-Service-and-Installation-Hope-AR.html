<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow.

CliftonLarsonAllen provided three years of benchmark data for electrical and mechanical contractors. If only some of the lights at your home are out, you may not see the point of calling an electrical company. There is also a ton of information on residential LED lighting within the Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) Program for the Evaluation and Analysis of Residential Lighting ( PEARL ).

<p>Remember to be cautious about troubleshooting such light installations as these bulbs could be lead to potential danger. Power strips — or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics — are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances. Typically a standard feature on stationary generators, it's increasingly common on portables.
