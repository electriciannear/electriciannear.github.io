<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>Pulling on a cord can damage the appliance, the plug or the outlet. If you are planning a home lighting design project, you obviously want to leave the task to someone who knows what they are doing. A master electrician is not only permitted to work on his own, he is the one who can bid for jobs, pull permits, lay out wiring systems and installations. The surge protector passes the surge along from the device to the system ground. It's important to note that surge protectors don't give you complete protection.</p>
<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
