Climbing a tree in contact with a power line can energize the tree with electricity and lead to electric shock or death.

I like 12v landscape wired lighting far better then the new LED wireless lights, and I figured I'd share some of the problems I ran into that you can avoid :) Thanks for the read and the vote Kristen.</p>
<p>Like everything in life, it pays to be prepared in the event of an electrical emergency. While they may only seem like a minor nuisance when it comes time to plug in a new appliance with three prongs, these older outlets need to go. Outdated and inefficient, they lack the proper grounding plug newer outlets have, which means they're more likely to cause an electrical fire in your home. Excellent services, details of job explained clearly up front. The best way for me to install these is to have a 12V power supply in the basement (probably just a computer power supply) and pull 2-conductor cables up from there.</p>
<p>Chart on left shows that 30 amp breaker matches 10 gauge copper wire. 1. Not Using A Voltmeter - While the introduction of LED landscape lighting has diminished the need for a voltmeter (because of the wider range of acceptable voltage), having this tool on hand is essential for systems of greater than 10 lights or for systems with wire runs longer than 100 ft. And, is a must-have tool for troubleshooting a system. Solar outdoor lighting systems charge their batteries during the day and produce a low voltage light during the night time hours.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, low-voltage DC wiring (for example, wiring for 12 volts or 24 volts DC) needs to have a bigger wire gauge, not a smaller wire gauge, than 120-volt AC wiring (assuming loads of the same wattage),” Holladay says.
