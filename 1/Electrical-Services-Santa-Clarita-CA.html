<h3>Electrical Installation Services in Santa Clarita CA</h3>
<p>Fortunately, you can protect your equipment by simply installing surge protectors where these appliances plug into your wall. When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches. A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>But when it comes to outdoor landscape lighting, 120v has some drawbacks. Finally, get licensed or certified (if required). A common mistake is to get the largest unit available to power the entire house. Many electricians consider old panels that have been manufactured by Zinsco and FPE to be very problematic. This could involve isolating components and evaluating their circuit parameters or isolating the circuits by group when dealing with a complicated circuit.</p>
<p>Switch boxes and ceiling boxes can have neutral, or they can be without neutral wire. But there are a couple of things almost any homeowner can do to promote electrical safety, such as labeling circuit breakers and wiring, and replacing old outlets with GFCI ( ground-fault circuit interrupter ) outlets.

Be aware of the fire risk that damaged power cords pose, and the fact that extension cords are only intended for temporary use.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules.
