To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>This means that 12-gauge wire will work for your landscape lighting system. Outdoor landscape lights are used to highlight trees, gardens, fountains, walkways and anything else that you want to call attention to. Not only are these lights beautiful in their own right, but they also increase general nighttime visibility, which improves safety and discourages would-be intruders.
