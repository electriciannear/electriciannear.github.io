One interesting thing to note about electrical service panels is, unlike a lot of the appliances you use in your home, service panels slowly decline over several months before they finally stop working. The standard time for lights of this nature to light up is typically five minutes.</p>

<p>If your electrical panel is very old and not designed to handle the electrical usage that is currently taking place, you may be facing a serious fire hazard. Service personnel came out and laid out the bed for the generator and installed a platform around the generator bed.
