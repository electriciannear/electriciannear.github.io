<h3>Basic Home Electrical Wiring Glen Cove NY 11542</h3>
<p>There is a problem if the voltage climbs above 120 volts, and a surge protector assists to keep that problem from destroying your computer or any other sensitive electric equipments. Maintenance can be performed by skilled installers rather than licensed electricians, whereas for traditional lighting systems a trained electrician is the safe choice. A home inspector might even point out that it is because of knob and tube wiring without an electrician's proper metering equipment and the ability to use it correctly, you will not know for sure.</p>
<p>Applicants may substitute education in electrical curriculum for up to 1 year of the required 4 years of experience. Excessive voltage drop is critical to the proper operation of the luminaires and the length of run may require larger wire than 12 AWG to ensure proper voltage to the lighting units. Homes built in recent years can, therefore, accommodate 220-volt circuits as well, which can be distinguished in the circuit box because the switches they use are twice the size of those for 110-volt circuits.</p>
