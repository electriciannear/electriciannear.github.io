We do Generators better than anyone else, and our pricing and level of service is unbeatable. Like a power strip, it provides extension outlets for your devices but its main job is to minimize the damage caused by random power fluctuations called power surges.</p>
<p>The panel uses the sun to charge a battery on the lamp, eliminating the need for electrical wires and a transformer. These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family. Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>

Thankfully, it wasn't anything more serious, but it woke you up about electrical safety.</p>
<p>Circuit breakers prevent fires, Ground fault circuit breakers protect from electrical shocks, and smoke alarms alert occupants of an emergency.
