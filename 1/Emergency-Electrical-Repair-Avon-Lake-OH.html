<p>Arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs), installed at the service panel, protect against such dangerous shorts and are now required in new bedroom circuits. How to Become One : Most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch. The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>
<p>Journeyman License: 5 years of working experience are required. 2. Solar Landscape Lighting - is a perfect way to bring forth light to your pathways around your house or business areas. A properly functioning electrical panel is essential to the safety of your family and your home. Or study materials recommended by such industry pillars as the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) prior to taking the journeymen electrician license test. Intermittent humming or crackling noises coming from the electrical panel are reasons to call an electrician immediately.</p>
