<p>Both outlets of the same receptacle are controlled by the existing light switch. If you're having circuit and panel capacity issues, we offer FREE in-home estimates by licensed electricians so you can be sure your home will remain safe. The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet. Also think about adding outlets inside bathroom drawers and cabinets to plug in devices like electric toothbrushes, razors, and blow dryers. Call us at (509) 362-9556 to discuss your indoor and outdoor lighting. The polarity of these wires is not important; either wire on the output side of the transformer may be connected to either wire of the low voltage circuit. If electrical panels are allowed to age too fire they can become a serious hazard to your home or business.</p>
<p>Natural gas, propane, and diesel are the most common fuel types. Have a qualified electrician add more receptacle outlets in your home to reduce the use of extension cords. These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time. Damaged or Cracked Outlet plate - If your plate surrounding the outlet is damaged significantly, you may have electrical damage or dangerous wiring. Pendant Lighting: We can install hanging lights or pendant lighting in homes with high ceilings.</p>
<p>When you put together a computer system, one piece of standard equipment you'll probably buy is a surge protector. To get the most accurate size panel for your home, we recommend having a professional electrician calculate your home's electrical load. Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
