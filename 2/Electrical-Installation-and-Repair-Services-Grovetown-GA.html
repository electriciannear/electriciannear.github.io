Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>
<p>Protection of the power line against direct strokes is through a ground wire or protector tube. Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider.
