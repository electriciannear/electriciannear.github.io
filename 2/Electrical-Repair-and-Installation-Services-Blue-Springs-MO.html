After completing this course, participants should be able to explain what an oscilloscope does, explain how to set up an oscilloscope for use, identify the controls used to adjust an oscilloscope display, and explain how to use an oscilloscope to make voltage measurements and time measurements.</p>
<p>Either way will require running some new wire to the wall, but if you could add a second switch in the same stud bay as the outlet it might be easier to do that. Higher voltage ratings give less protection. Some appliances or equipment require heavy-duty cords. Trimming and minor pruning around landscape fixtures.
