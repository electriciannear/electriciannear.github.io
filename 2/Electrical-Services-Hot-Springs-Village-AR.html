The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move. For example, National Electrical Code (NEC) changes, though still the biggest draw for contractor training, dropped to 54 percent from 71 percent in spite of the fact 2017 was an update year. Simply splice into the wire going to the permanently hot side of the half-hot, and splice into the neutral wire and ground as well.</p>
<p>All backup generators we carry are backed with a guaranteed written warranty for parts and labor. This should not come as a surprise, as practically everything in the modern world requires the use of systems that electrical engineers design and develop.
