<p>Portable generators are more reasonably priced, starting at about $300, but they tend to be substantially less powerful and don't turn on automatically when the power goes out. If a pet should receive a shock, never touch the animal until you know it is away from the power source or the electric current is shut off to prevent injury yourself. This can leave homeowners with electrical wiring that is not really suitable for the higher electrical needs we have today.</p>

Certificate renewal guidelines usually require an accumulation of X amount of electrician training hours within a year span.
