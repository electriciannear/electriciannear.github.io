The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>Some electricians — especially those who haven't been around for a while or who aren't really savvy with the code — will steer customers in a different direction just for not having the correct knowledge,” Volpe says. Can provide service for the lifetime of the generator. This is because these circuits will likely take appliances that draw greater amperage.
