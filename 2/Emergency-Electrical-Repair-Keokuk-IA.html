They can be used for a purely functional reason, like providing security or lighting pathways and entryways, or used for as a decorative piece for an outdoor area.</p>
<p>CREATING THIS EFFECT: Path lights are staggered around the walkway to create pools of light that illuminate a safe passage to the home's entrance. Reading blueprints, or technical diagrams of a work site's electrical wiring.
