<h3>Protect Your Home With a Whole House Surge Protector in Greensburg PA</h3>
<p>No matter how great your surge protection is, if lightening strikes your house, all bets are off. According to the National Institute for Burn Medicine, more than half of all burn accidents involving infants and children can be prevented by lower water heater settings. The best solution is to put all three white wires, plus an additional one about 6" long, into a wire nut. We are a fully accredited and certified company that performs the necessary electrical work.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows a two conductor cable from the circuit breaker panel going to a wall switch. Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>The ON Smart Solution 4-Outlet Surge Protector offers the flexibility to charge while protecting multiple devices. This article will walk you through how a basic electrical outlet works, and a few different types of outlets you may have in your home. New LED bulbs also contain micro circuit boards that are sensitive and can easily be compromised by an electrical surge. Point-of-use surge protection devices are located at or near the equipment and have fax, modem, telephone and cable capabilities.</p>
