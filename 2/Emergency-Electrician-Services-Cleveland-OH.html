Restricted electrical licences (RELs) are issued to tradespersons other than electricians. A master electrician is expected to have a working knowledge of the current edition of the National Electrical Code, the Part 8 rules of the Construction Code Act No. 230 of 1972, and of the act itself. If neutrals are present inside box, then they will be the white wires that are twisted together, covered with wire nut and pushed to back of box.</p>
