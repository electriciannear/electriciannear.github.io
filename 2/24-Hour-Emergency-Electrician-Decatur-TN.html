Replacing or upgrading your breaker box will help to prevent electrical fires in your home, your appliances should work at peak efficiency, and you'll add value to your home. You need an electrical licence before you can do any electrical wiring work in NSW, regardless of the cost of the work and regardless of whether the work is residential, commercial or industrial.</p>
<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits. In the U.S., electrical contracting is an industry valued at over $171 billion annually, made up of over 70,000 electrical contracting firms employing over 650,000 electrical workers. If your certificate is more than 90 days past the expiration date, you must reapply and take the master electrical examination to reinstate your certificate.</p>
