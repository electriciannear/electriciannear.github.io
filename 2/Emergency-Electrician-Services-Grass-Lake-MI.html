<h3>How To Install Landscape Lighting Grass Lake MI 49240</h3>
<p>Decide where you will plan to use landscape fixtures and the type of light you expect them to provide - uplighting, silhouetting, grazing lighting, wall washing, etc. While this is often sold to new installers as an easy-to-install method, it results in decreased efficiency (higher electrical costs due to resistance created by small-gauge cable pre-attached to the fixtures) and the drain of your transformer's power capacity. 3. Replace or repair damaged electrical cords to keep your home safe.</p>
<p>This means that there is a single length of wire running from the transformer to each of the lights in sequence. From bollards to recessed wall lights and all of the necessary hardware, Hinkley offers the ideal contemporary solution to landscape lighting. Those tables provide the maximum power limits for a Class 2 power supply and are far too restrictive to be applied generally to all low voltage lighting installations using a Class 2 power transformer. Another key point is that each master electrician out there started day one on the job not knowing which colored wire nut to use when.</p>

<h3>Home Electrical Wiring in Grass Lake MI</h3>
<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>

<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>In that case the electrician may run a 14-2 wire (hot, neutral, ground) from the receptacle box to the switch, putting black tape on the ends of the white wire to show that BOTH wires are actually carrying current.
