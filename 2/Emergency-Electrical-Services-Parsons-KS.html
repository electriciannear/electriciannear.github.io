<h3>Industrial Electrical Services in Parsons KS</h3>
<p>Electricians know the ins and outs of designing lighting systems, installing street lights and intercom systems, ensuring electrical work is up to code and repairing electrical wiring. Most modern appliances could easily overload an outdated electrical panel, which could cause issues for your home. A certified service provider for GE and Generac Generators, we ensure your backup generator is properly installed and maintained year after year. The alternative was aluminum wiring which was plentiful and cheap, but the potential danger it posed was not recognized at the time.</p>

<p>In addition, electrical panel upgrade can help in reducing your homeowner's insurance bill. Area electrical board members determine percentage requirements. Another level of safety for your home's electrical system is having a grounded wire and grounded outlets. As you might expect, your generator's power output must match your home's electrical requirements. We understand that electrical issues are not only a major inconvenience but can also be potential fire hazards.</p>
<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
