<p>Electrical maintenance personnel are responsible for keeping circuit breakers and switchgear working properly and for performing periodic inspections and any necessary repairs. If you are in the process of building a new home, our licensed electrician contractors can help to lay the groundwork for reliable wiring in the early stages.
