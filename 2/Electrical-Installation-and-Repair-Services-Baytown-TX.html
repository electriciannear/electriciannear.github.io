<p>Not all UL listed SPDs are necessarily rated for use with a lightning protection system. Surges can be caused by birds, small animals, falling trees, or vehicles crashing into power poles, but the most obvious is lightning. Voltage indicators are pen-like pocket tools used to check for the presence of AC voltage over 50 volts. On this particular receptacle box, the black wires go with the gold screws. The reason is electrical contractors use it and most of the time in buildings and homes.</p>
<p>Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets.

Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
