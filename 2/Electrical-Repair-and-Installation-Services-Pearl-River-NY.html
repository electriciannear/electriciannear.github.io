<h2>Landscape Lighting in Pearl River New York</h2>
<p>Even if you aren't tripping the breakers right now, a 100 amp panel in a modern home is running far too close to capacity to be safe for long term use.

Houses built or rewired more than 30 years ago may have 60- or 100-amp service (amps are a measure of the quantity of electric power).

<p>After your new generator is installed, worrying about a power outage will be a lot less of an interruption in your life. Once the electricity comes back on, the generator will go back into standby mode and wait for the next time it's needed. A backup generator will come in handy in such times as it will provide light, heat , and energy to powerhouse appliances Heat is essential more so during the winter months, and the generator can save lives if people in the home depend on powered equipment.</p>
