<p>Coho Lighting is a licensed Wisconsin electrical contractor specializing in LED parking lot lighting installation and repair throughout Southeastern Wisconsin. A new skylight that has been properly installed should not leak, even during a downpour. Our expert connects all the wires together and then runs short individual wires (pigtails) to the receptacle. It's safe to say that this unit is as reliable a backup power source as you could hope to get.

<p>Our home generator installation and services can provide you with some much needed electricity in the event of a blackout or even be used to supplement a solar system and abandon the grid totally.
