<p>Based on the unit installed, emergency power can be supplied to some or all of your residence of place of business. The running” capacity shows the maximum power the system can operate at over extended periods of time, while the starting capacity shows the maximum power the system can get to for a few seconds. It also comes with a 200-amp automatic transfer switch, which switches on the generator when electricity is cut off. There are a few different styles of landscaping lights, too.</p>
<p>At the same time, LED lights offer the option of brighter light to strongly illuminate certain areas. Voltage drop can occur from line loss over a long line of lights.
