Many injuries occur in the kitchen and bathroom areas, because of their proximity to water and the most common injuries are from electrical appliances, frayed electrical cords and overhead power lines.</p>
<p>Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits.
