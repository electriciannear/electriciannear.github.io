Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
