From 2003 - 2007, 53% of electrical failure home fires involved other known types of equipment. The constant plugging and unplugging of appliances into outlets and turning lights on and off cause wear and tear over time.

A bad neutral could let enough power through to run a night light, especially if it is an LED, but not enough to operate a heavy appliance.

<p>The surge protector receptacle thus ensures that your critical devices such as heavy duty servers would remain protected in the event of unwarned mishaps. A circuit breaker panel also offers safety to Renton homeowners, as all of the electrical connections are inside a breaker box. Generators that have alternative fuel capability will be an even better choice as they will not limit you to just one fuel source.

<p>Power generator failure can be due to a variety of causes, such as improper installation or lack of maintenance. If your electrical panel has suffered water damage, then it is time to upgrade it. For example, rust is one sign of water damage. If your old 100-amp breaker box goes kaput, Chambers recommends a 100-amp replacement because, for instance, Your stove is gas-fired, your water heater is gas, your heating is gas, and you really only need electricity for air conditioning and lights and 120-volt outlets, so a 100-amp breaker panel is plenty for a house like that," he says.</p>
