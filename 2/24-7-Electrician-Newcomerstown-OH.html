Understanding of mathematical and scientific principles - While electricians don't need advanced mathematical and scientific skills, they will apply the basic principles of these disciplines to their work.

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.
