<h3>New And Creative Ways To Use Landscape Lights In Your Garden Alpharetta GA 30022</h3>
<p>Decora is a brand of light switches known for their flat, sleek appearance and ease-of-use. With over 40 years of experience, we're electrical repair experts. Avoid overloading plugs, sockets, and extension cords. Below, we show you how to wire a double switch, an unswitched plug, and a switch-controlled receptacle. Electricity powers many devices that make our everyday lives easier and more convenient. For appropriate surge protection for your whole house, you'll require a protector wired into the electrical panel.</p>
<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do. You will have to figure out which of the existing switch wires is permanent, and hot and splice into that wire to supply the new switch. Older electrical panels can't always accommodate multiple devices like air conditioners, HDTVs, and clothes dryers running simultaneously. Try to distribute small appliances and electronic devices to several outlets to avoid overwhelming the one.</p>
