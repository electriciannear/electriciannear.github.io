<p>Electricity is important to the workings of the home, but can be dangerous, especially to children. Transmission and Distribution Construction services (includes electrical design, development, maintenance and testing services)Transmission lines carry high voltage current from the substation, where the power is produced. Arc faults happen when electricity crosses a gap between damaged wiring such as loose, corroded, or overloaded connections in walls, appliances, and cords.</p>

Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
