Cons: Home standby generators are pricier to buy, and installation costs can range from a few thousand dollars to $10,000 or more. Theory: Perhaps one set of Romex conductors from the outlet was connected to the switch before.” (This seems to be the case for the Family Room switched outlet.)

<p>Low voltage landscape lighting is safer for use outdoors because it reduces the risks of electrocution when installing a system or repairing one. We'll take care of all the details and provide complete lighting solutions that you can enjoy without any hassle. From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>If a breaker keeps tripping immediately after it's reset but the circuit's not overloaded, contact a licensed electrician immediately. If you purchase a transformer that doesn't have a photocell light sensor, you will probably be adjusting the on time about every 2 months, remember, I learned this through trial and error, it wasn't a big deal at first, but it seems to wear on me after a few years. Make sure your property is prepared for a power outage by installing a backup generator.</p>
<p>Since my new cable only had black and a white (and green ground) wires, I identified the white as hot with black electrical tape. No matter what type of lighting service you're in need of, Anything Electric has the expertise to assist you with your residential or commercial lighting project.
