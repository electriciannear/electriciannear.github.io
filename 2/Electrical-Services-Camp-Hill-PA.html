The generator runs on a home's existing natural gas or LP fuel supply. We are a Generac Elite Dealer, so we have extensive experience in the series and the types of generators they offer. Electricians with further certifications may have met even more stringent performance and customer service guidelines, so you know you are receiving the highest quality electrical service.</p>
<p>Natural gas, propane, and diesel are the most common fuel types. Have a qualified electrician add more receptacle outlets in your home to reduce the use of extension cords. These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time. Damaged or Cracked Outlet plate - If your plate surrounding the outlet is damaged significantly, you may have electrical damage or dangerous wiring. Pendant Lighting: We can install hanging lights or pendant lighting in homes with high ceilings.</p>
