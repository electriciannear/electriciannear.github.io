<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>Low voltage lights can then be installed throughout the interior landscape to showcase trees, ornamentation, foliage, gardens, and flower beds. If a Prometric (formerly Block & Associates) examination is passed (a requirement for licensing in all local jurisdictions), all licensing jurisdictions will honor the passing score when considering an applicant for licensure. Basically, the electrical current flows from the wall to your surge protector and then to your electrical devices.</p>

Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers.

Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
