Most do it yourselfers will buy a low voltage outdoor lighting kit the first time around, and it's not a bad choice, but beware of the connectors you get in the kit. Canopy Lighting - Canopy lights are large fixtures designed to effectively light a space for navigation and safety such as parking lots or gas stations. This particular type of lighting is specially designed to accent floral and landscape arrangements throughout your yard.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present.

The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>If so, the first switch could be removed, with the wires simply spliced through the box and a blank cover put on it. A resistance measurement of.005 ohms from ground point of the generator or battery to ground terminal of any electrical device may be considered satisfactory.
