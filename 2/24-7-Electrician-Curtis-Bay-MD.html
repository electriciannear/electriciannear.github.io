Electricians must take precautions to avoid getting hurt. No person may engage in the business of installing, repairing, or maintaining electrical wiring unless the person is licensed as an electrical contractor by the DSPS.

To get the most accurate size panel for your home, we recommend having a professional electrician calculate your home's electrical load. Always make sure your circuit breakers can handle the load you give them. If you notice an acrid smell from your panel or notice any discolored marks near to the circuit breakers, there is the chance of an electrical fire If you observe signs of a fire, you should immediately look for services to upgrade the electrical panel.</p>
