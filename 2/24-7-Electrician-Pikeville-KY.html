<p>You must also have 576 hours of electrical-related classroom education. Bottom line: I recommend that you purchase a new high-quality surge protector (#ad) to protect your new computer from routine power surges and distant lightning strikes. I think it's safe to say that in general it's common practice to use a twist-on connector to splice pigtails or individual wires at an individual hot or neutral wire where more connections are needed than fit with the original wire.</p>

Don't forget to keep your appliances away from water, check for correct wattage light bulbs, and check the insulation on a cord. There is no point in time at which the light source ceases to function; instead, LEDs gradually degrade in performance over time. If you want to add more lights, you may need a bigger transformer; if so, it's probably more economical to buy a whole new system in a kit.</p>
