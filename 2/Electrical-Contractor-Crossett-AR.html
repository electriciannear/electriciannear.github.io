<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems.

We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
