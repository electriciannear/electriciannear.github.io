<p>2500-joule energy rating provides maximum protection of all your sensitive electronic devices. In order to understand which generator transfer switch is best for your installation, it's recommended to speak with a generator specialist.

Even if you turn off power, electrical wiring can be tricky and is best left to the professionals. The TLC folks promptly responded and scheduled a time to repair or replace right away.</p>
