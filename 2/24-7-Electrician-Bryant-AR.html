<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box. For example, for an installation where you would want to hide wires behind a wall, the wires could be surrounded by insulation, creating a warmer environment. Circuit breakers provide the same type of time-delay features that equal-size time-delay fuses provide. Because a light switch is indeed switching a hot wire to the light, you've got power at the switch location.</p>

Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>

<p>The ON Smart Solution 4-Outlet Surge Protector offers the flexibility to charge while protecting multiple devices. This article will walk you through how a basic electrical outlet works, and a few different types of outlets you may have in your home. New LED bulbs also contain micro circuit boards that are sensitive and can easily be compromised by an electrical surge. Point-of-use surge protection devices are located at or near the equipment and have fax, modem, telephone and cable capabilities.</p>
