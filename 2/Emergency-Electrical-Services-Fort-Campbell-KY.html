<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>Sounds like an overcrowded electrical box is bending and damaging connections when you push the receptacle back into the box - an unsafe condition risking fire or shock. From time to time, you may need to add more electrical appliances to your home. What you should know about buying an emergency standby generator. Problems that appear minor on the surface sometimes cause major safety issues down the road.
