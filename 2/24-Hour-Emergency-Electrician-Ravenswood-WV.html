<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening. To use a portable generator without the hassle of running extension cords, hire an electrician to install a manual transfer switch subpanel off your main circuit panel and install a dedicated inlet to power the subpanel (installing the subpanel is complex; not a DIY project).</p>

There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>

Installing a new electrical panel in your home will increase your safety and peace of mind knowing that the heart of your electrical system is working properly for you and your home.
