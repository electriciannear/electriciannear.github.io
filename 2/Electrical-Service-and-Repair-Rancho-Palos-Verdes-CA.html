The boxes have labels to tell you what color wires go into each hole. Either unplug some items or call an electrician to discuss your increased electrical needs. Safety: A neutral can be just as dangerous as a hot wire, with the potential to electrocute you or to "ground out" and electrify any metal it comes in contact with.</p>

<p>Select a good, reliable, energy efficient light source - professional LED fixtures or MR16 halogen and xenon lamps are very popular options.

<h3>Fundamentals of Working With a Licensed Electrical Contractor in Rancho Palos Verdes CA</h3>
<p>Both outlets of the same receptacle are controlled by the existing light switch. If you're having circuit and panel capacity issues, we offer FREE in-home estimates by licensed electricians so you can be sure your home will remain safe. The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't. When it detects an interruption in your main utility service, it safely switches you from that power source to the standby generator's power. Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>
