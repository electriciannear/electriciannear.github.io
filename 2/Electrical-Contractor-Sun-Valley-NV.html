These low voltage switches use momentary contact to control the power, so the small-magnitude, low volt current only flows for the length of time that the switch is being pressed. Jasper H. and Phyllis Wyman have lost power dozens of times during the 31 years they've lived in their restored farmhouse in Pittsfield, Maine.</p>
<p>Usually, a circuit breaker sub panel will service one separate area that has a discrete function, such as a kitchen, shop, office, or addition.
