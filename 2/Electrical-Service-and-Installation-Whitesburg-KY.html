<p>The Electrical Safety Foundation International is a non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to promoting electrical safety at home and in the workplace. Improper Installation ­- Right from the start, if the wiring on your breaker panel is not done correctly, it can cause numerous problems for you. In most homes, lighting and small appliance circuits are 15 or 20 amps, and major appliances are on 20, 50 or even 60 amp circuits. This in turn paves the way for the most sophisticated lighting ever developed on our world, and quite possibly, the singular source of lighting used both commercially and residentially in the very near future: LED commercial lighting fixtures.</p>
