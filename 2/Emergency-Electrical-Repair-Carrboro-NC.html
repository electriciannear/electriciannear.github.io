<h3>Why Surge Protectors Are So Important in Carrboro NC</h3>
<p>Surge protectors are typically installed connected to a home's electrical service box. You can imagine these little wires that lead through your house to your electrical outlet are going to be a lot like the veins and capillaries of your house leading back to the main arteries that connect to the electrical panel. Brighten up exterior spaces to provide the safety and security you need at night while highlighting trees and shrubs. Today's computers, appliances and home theater equipment are more sophisticated than ever and are especially vulnerable to electrical surges.</p>
<p>They don't necessarily break down all at once and stop working, which is why they can cause warning signs ahead of time and notify you simply on its performance if it's indeed time to upgrade it. Luckily, here at Beacon Electrical Services, we can maintain and update your service panel. Even if your home does not have aluminum wiring, but it is an older home, you still may be at risk of electrical fire.

<p>Standby generators permanently connect to your home's or business's electrical system. Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers. Every generator has a fuel source that it's powered by. Unless you are using a wind generator, you will most likely have to store fuel in preparation for power outages. Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
