<h3>Should I Use Surge Protection for My Home Appliances in Jenkintown PA?</h3>
<p>Surge protectors are typically installed connected to a home's electrical service box. You can imagine these little wires that lead through your house to your electrical outlet are going to be a lot like the veins and capillaries of your house leading back to the main arteries that connect to the electrical panel.

ElectriCall, LLC has been providing electrical services to families, individuals, and businesses since 2011.</p>
<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>But electricity is responsible for an average of 70 deaths and 350,000 serious injuries in the UK every year, so it's important you take steps to protect yourself and your loved ones from electrical dangers.
