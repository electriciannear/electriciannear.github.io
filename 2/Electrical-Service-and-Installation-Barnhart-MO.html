The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
<p>Turn the power off at the circuit breaker. If you find yourself using extension cords very often, consider having an electrician install new outlets throughout your home. What this rating means is that it can handle greater surges than devices with a lower In rating.
