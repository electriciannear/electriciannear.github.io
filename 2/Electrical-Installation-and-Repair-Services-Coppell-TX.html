The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>
<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights.

During storms or unexplained electrical accidents, there is a huge chance that you have to deal with your electrical devices consistently shutting off and restarting.</p>
<p>A common misconception many homeowners have is that they can protect their home from dangerous lightning strikes and voltage surges simply by plugging their TV or computer into a power strip or just installing a surge protective panel. Grounded circuits are safer than ungrounded circuits. Lightning and other high-energy transient voltage surges can be suppressed with pole mounted suppressors by the utility, or with an owner supplied whole house surge protector.</p>
