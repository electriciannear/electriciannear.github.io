<p>Both outlets of the same receptacle are controlled by the existing light switch. If you're having circuit and panel capacity issues, we offer FREE in-home estimates by licensed electricians so you can be sure your home will remain safe. The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>Replacing the main circuit breaker costs between $40 to $100 for the part and another $40 to $100 per hour to have an electrician install it. The main circuit breaker shuts off the electricity to the house in one move.

Simply splice into the wire going to the permanently hot side of the half-hot, and splice into the neutral wire and ground as well.</p>
<p>Do note that a power strip is simply an over glorified extension cord while a protector will actually protect your equipment from damage. If you want to have standby backup power for your entire house, you are going to need almost double the largest size to power most homes completely. Due to an ever-increasing requirement for improving energy conservation efforts and the importance that this initiative will have on our future and well-being, it makes sense that by using these lower voltage lights and saving more energy that you can also take part in helping with the conservation goals needed to prevent using up our valuable energy resources or to continue rapidly depleting them.</p>
<p>If we lose power on one circuit we want the other still working so that there is safe lighting in the area. Light switches may feel like an afterthought, but they are critical to your home's lighting system. I was taken aback by the price, but - It went very well - arrived on time, did the job with no fuss, supplied a generator for the fridge for the time the power was out, cleaned up after themselves, and responded quickly when city inspector wanted something changed.</p>
