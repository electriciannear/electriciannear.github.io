<p>Generators are sized according to wattage produced: The more watts, the bigger the unit - and the higher the price tag. Do not use extension cords or multi-outlet converters for appliances. And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors. However, by installing surge protectors where needed, you can protect the multiple pieces of equipment that share a common electric outlet.</p>
<p>The unpredictability of outages gives stationary, permanently installed standby generators a clear advantage over their portable, gas-powered kin, which resemble big lawn-mower engines on dollies. Supervision Electrician: You need to show proofs of 4 years of experience as a licensed journey worker electrician. Purchasing a generator from Electric Generators Direct provides you with the same service options as if you were to purchase one from your local home improvement warehouse.</p>

Sometimes your transformer will also have a green wire that should be attached to groundâ. This grounding wire neutralizes any dangerous electrical current into the ground. A key smart maintenance tip: Hire in a professional electrician annually to check your electrical systems, just as you would get a checkup for your personal health.</p>
