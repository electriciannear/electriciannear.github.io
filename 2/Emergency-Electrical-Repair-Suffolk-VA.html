<p>I try to keep my electrical services as affordable as possible, so here are some coupons and occasionally some special deals for you to save some money on. So feel free to use these discounts for your next lighting installation, outlet replacement, circuit breaker repair, or whatever electrical installation or repair you might need. In our neighborhood, there are 8 homes within a block of me running whole-house backup generators. It sounds like you have a switched outlet, perhaps with the switch disabled.</p>
<p>Remember to be cautious about troubleshooting such light installations as these bulbs could be lead to potential danger. Power strips — or better yet, surge protectors, which absorb common power surges that can damage electronics — are an inexpensive and safe way to add extra outlets in most circumstances.

You are correct to be careful about moving outlets or any other device when the existing wires are too short.
