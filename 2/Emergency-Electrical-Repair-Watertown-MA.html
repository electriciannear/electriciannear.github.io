<p>When lightning strikes near a building with no protection, it can travel inside via power lines directly connected to the switchboard. Many people are currently doing this improvement, because in the majority of homes, circuit breaker panels are usually 100 amp. And all modern Wi-Fi enabled, digital dimmers and USB charging outlets are tight fits in older single gang boxes.
