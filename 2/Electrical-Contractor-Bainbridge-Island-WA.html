A rare, but destructive cause of power surges is lightning, but when it strikes, you'll wish you had surge protection.</p>
<p>Limited - If you have not completed an approved apprenticeship program, you must show three years of experience supervised by a licensed master or limited electrician. Simply put, this method allows easy troubleshooting and insures proper distribution of power across all lighting fixtures.
