PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>
