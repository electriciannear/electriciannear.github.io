On the other hand, if you want your house to remain lit even during a power outage, you can opt for a small sized generator. PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>

Electrical Contractor License: It can be obtained by both individuals and companies. Journeyman Electrician - You must show at least 8,000 hours of work experience. Also, you need to pass the master journeyman exam successfully.

A resistance measurement of.005 ohms from ground point of the generator or battery to ground terminal of any electrical device may be considered satisfactory.
