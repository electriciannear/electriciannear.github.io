This will allow the switch or outlet to be mounted flush with the wall which will make it easier to use. Attach the wire to each light fixture; many low voltage light fixtures use quick connectors to make this process simple.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide effective outdoor lighting that provides safety , security and beauty for the property owners, their family and their guests.
