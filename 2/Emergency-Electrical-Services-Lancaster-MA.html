Although a lot of manufactures supply their fixtures with plastic quick connectors”, we recommend that you throw those away, and use silicon filled wire connectors. To stay safe around electricity, you need to understand the dangers, and to take a series of precautions every time you work with electrical equipment. Consumers can use ESFI's In Home Electrical Safety Check and Out-door Electrical Safety Check booklets to conduct an electrical safety audit of their homes.</p>

When you call Mr. Electric, we will inspect around your electrical panels if you have an older home and provide fuse box upgrades in Roswell if you need it. Some homes may require a fuse box upgrade to lessen the risk of a fire or electrocution.
