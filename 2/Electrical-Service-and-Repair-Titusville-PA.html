<p>Basic transfer switches will require a user to manually switch from the primary to the secondary power source. Outlets are the doorway to your electrical system. They are very reliable and trusted electricians. All peripherals (printers, backup storage, etc.) should be connected to avoid any potential damage and provide full protection. Whether that's a breaker panel repair or a complete panel upgrade, you can count on our Marquette electricians to provide the service you need.</p>
<p>The average electrical panel upgrade takes about 8 to 10 hours to complete.
