Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>This seems conflicting to our brains though… Usually when we think of a source of electricity being closed,” we start to automatically think that this must be a circuit that is receiving no power.

First, only 14 (not 12) gauge wires are to be inserted in the "quick-wire" holes available on the back of many receptacles and switches. I have tried to get several electricians in the past to perform this service for me and either they didn't know how to do it or they quoted an absurd price to avoid the job.</p>
