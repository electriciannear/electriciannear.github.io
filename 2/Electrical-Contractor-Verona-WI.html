<p>Low voltage landscape lighting is safer for use outdoors because it reduces the risks of electrocution when installing a system or repairing one. We'll take care of all the details and provide complete lighting solutions that you can enjoy without any hassle. From path lights to step lights to led rope lights and recessed trim lighting, the variety is endless. The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
