Our fully certified electricians will be there on time, every time, and won't stop working until everything has been returned to its normal, functional state.</p>
<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected. This is the preferred method of wiring a half-hot switched outlet, because if the power is coming from the switch, it is most likely a lighting circuit that is intended to operate lights, not outlets.</p>
<p>The new electrical panels do come with trip switches that simply cuts off the power when there is an overload. With our monthly lighting inspection, the Alameda Electric team works in partnership with your team to represent your property in the best possible way.

<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
