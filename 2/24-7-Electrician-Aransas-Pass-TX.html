<p>Children must learn that appliances such as hair dryers and electric shavers are not toys and must never be played with in the bathroom. The system was installed a few days later and the technicians (Mark and Kara) did a very thorough and professional installation. Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
