If your living room circuit isn't set up to supply enough power for a big screen TV, a 5.1 or 7.1 television surround sound system, a cable box, a DVD player, an X-Box or Playstation, floor and table lights, an Amazon Echo, phone charging, a stereo, and more … then you have a problem you may not know about until it's too late. These units are designed to provide backup power automatically through a transfer switch that detects when the main power sources goes out.</p>
<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back.
