<p>It employs several types of conventional instruments and meters to measure system parameters, such as voltage, amps, rpm, pressure, temperature, Watts, Watt-hours, kilovolt-amps, and power factor. The bare ground wire—if there is one— is connected to the green grounding screw on the switch. Use a noncontact voltage tester like this to double-check that all wires in a box are dead” after turning off the circuit breaker. Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>
<p>Plug the transformer into the outdoor receptacle, and set the timer. Our certified installers will assemble your outdoor lighting design.
