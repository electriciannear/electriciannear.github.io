<p>Changing an electrical service panel isn't like changing a fuse or wiring a new ceiling fan. An electrical surge is an unexpected and uncontrolled spike in voltage on an electrical circuit. Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen.

<p>Recessed: Recessed lighting is a type of fixture that is embedded into a ceiling or type of lighting is sometimes called can lighting.
