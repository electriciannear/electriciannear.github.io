<h2>Generator Repair & Replacement in Broadview Illinois</h2>

Your home will lose power during part of the process, but a good electrician will know how to minimize this time. If an appliance falls into a filled tub or sink, or if you touch an electrical appliance with wet hands or while standing in water, you risk severe electrical shock and possibly death. Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>

A qualified electrician must be called in to install a transfer switch to plug the generator to the home wiring system.
