<p>Whether or not you need to add wiring: If you install a light where no wiring exists, the overall cost of the installation project will increase. The test is pretty easy (I mean electricians need to pass this) and costs about $50. First, only 14 (not 12) gauge wires are to be inserted in the "quick-wire" holes available on the back of many receptacles and switches. I have tried to get several electricians in the past to perform this service for me and either they didn't know how to do it or they quoted an absurd price to avoid the job.</p>
<p>Home electrical problems start an estimated 53,600 fires each year, according to the Electrical Safety Foundation International. At the outlets, each is wired using a pigtail splice to make the hot and neutral connections. Transformers are priced according to wattage, so by choosing low-wattage LED lights, you'll saveon the bost of both your transformer and your monthly electric bill. Master Electrician License: It can be obtained at the local level but the requirements vary.</p>
