The white (neutral) wire connects to the silver screw, or you place it in the back wire hole on the same side of the device as the silver screw. The white wire is the "neutral" wire, which takes any unused electricity and current and sends them back to the breaker panel.</p>
<p>Lighting Tip: You can run 12-gauge about 100 feet without voltage drop issues as long as the total wattage of the fixtures on the wire is 100 Watts or less.

<p>Portable generators are more reasonably priced, starting at about $300, but they tend to be substantially less powerful and don't turn on automatically when the power goes out.
