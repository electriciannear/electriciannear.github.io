<p>Electric panels are used to regulate the flow of electricity for your home while also being the main location of all electrical circuits. Sometimes the wiring at a light box is passing the circuit through to various outlets in the area, so that care must be taken to connect everything back as it was. In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>
<p>This may even be more expensive than your initial light installation costs. Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them.
