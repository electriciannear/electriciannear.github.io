If you are in the process of building a new home, our licensed electrician contractors can help to lay the groundwork for reliable wiring in the early stages. Moreover, it's advisable to install the generator as close as possible to its fuel supply and the transfer switch. Knowing what part of the outdoor lighting is crucial , and those that aren't as important will help the designer plan well, and even see you save you some money in the process.</p>
<p>Parking Lot Lighting - Parking lot lights are necessary for lighting and security. 5 common mistakes made while installing outdoor lighting.

Putting it into easily digestible words, a standby generator works with two major parts: it works with the generator itself and with a transfer switch. Be conscientious because, even though you've got the power off to the circuit you're working on, there are most likely wires behind your wall, and you don't want to get into a live circuit behind your wall.</p>
<p>Standby generators permanently connect to your home's or business's electrical system. Some stranded aluminum wiring is still used in houses today for the main service entry wires and other 240 volt circuits like ranges and clothes dryers.

Tip: Don't bury the cable more than 3 inches or you'll have difficulty connecting the light fixture.</p>
