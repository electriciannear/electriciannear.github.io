<p>All of the power for your home comes through this panel from the utility company to the exit wires that split off and service different parts of the house. You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel. Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>GFCI breakers work by sensing differences in electricity that flows into a circuit, caused by contact with humans or water.

<p>Low voltage lighting can be used in spaces in your home that other forms of lighting simply cannot fit. Gas-fueled generators are also usually less expensive to buy compared to their diesel counterparts.
