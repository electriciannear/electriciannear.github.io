We don't have a qualified or licensed electrician in our company hence I'm trying to get mine so i can do installation as well.</p>
<p>Upgrading an electrical panel is a serious endeavor that must be handled by a professional; this is not a DIY task. With todays technology, high voltage for landscape lighting is useless.
