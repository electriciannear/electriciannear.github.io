The problem can strike anytime from a lightning storm, blown transformer, or poor electrical supply from the utility company.</p>

A master electrician is not only permitted to work on his own, he is the one who can bid for jobs, pull permits, lay out wiring systems and installations. The surge protector passes the surge along from the device to the system ground. It's important to note that surge protectors don't give you complete protection.</p>
