<h3>How Electrical Contractors Can Give Back to the Sayville NY Community</h3>

Brighten up exterior spaces to provide the safety and security you need at night while highlighting trees and shrubs. Today's computers, appliances and home theater equipment are more sophisticated than ever and are especially vulnerable to electrical surges.</p>

<p>The quotient is how many amps your service panel must provide to safely meet your energy needs. A half-hot outlet looks like a typical duplex outlet but it has one half permanently on while the other half can be turned off and on via a wall switch. From breathtaking backyard installations to accent lighting that enhances the architectural beauty of your business to festive holiday displays, we'll make sure that after the sun goes down, your property shines.</p>
<p>A standard sized portable generator can use up to 22 gallons of gas or 4-8 20lb tanks of propane per day. You will never have a significant wait time at Turn It On Electric because we send our highly trained experts to sites equipped with all of the necessary parts and tools to fix your issues on the spot. Here are some important safety tips that will keep you and your loved ones safe around the house by preventing electrical hazards. If you are not running the electrical wire more than 80 feet from the electrical panel you can use 12 gauge electrical wires for a 20 amp GFI.</p>
