<p>Electrical cable Insulation. If your living room circuit isn't set up to supply enough power for a big screen TV, a 5.1 or 7.1 television surround sound system, a cable box, a DVD player, an X-Box or Playstation, floor and table lights, an Amazon Echo, phone charging, a stereo, and more … then you have a problem you may not know about until it's too late. These units are designed to provide backup power automatically through a transfer switch that detects when the main power sources goes out.</p>
