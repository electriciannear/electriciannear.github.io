<h3>Fundamentals of Working With a Licensed Electrical Contractor in Cape Girardeau MO</h3>
<p>The popularity of outdoor living has brought a new focus to outdoor lighting. From landscape lighting to area lights and architectural sign lighting. Avoid overloading extension cords, power strips, or outlets. Most breaker boxes are 100, 150 or 200 amps. Trust Graf Electric to professionally upgrade or service any type of commercial indoor lighting. It will also give you the peace of mind that the electrical panel is not the hazard it once was. Then, it might be a good idea to look into a standby generator installation.</p>
<p>And other light fixtures are completely weatherproof. Our NATE-certified technicians are trained to install portable and whole-home generators for any home in the area. Electrical Contractor License: According to the Board, municipalities can accept contracting business owners, their partners, chairman of the board or CEO that present the contracting business. Once you check that everything is working, bury the extra wire, secure the lights, and do any final adjustments to make sure everything looks good.</p>
<p>Your lighting system is likely to need a transformer, where 110 or 120-volt power is converted to 12VDC. Older homes with ungrounded outlets or homes with improper wiring and grounding will not be helped by a surge protector without the necessary upgrades. The electrician arrived on time and performed the work efficiently and professionally. Look for sparks or scorch marks when you plug electrical equipment into outlets. I keep the portable for when I do outside work at the back of our property (1+ acre) where running an extension to the house when using the electric trimmer doesn't work well due to the voltage drop.</p>
<p>Standby generators connect to your home's fuel supply (natural gas or propane). At the outlet box, if there are cables other than the new 3-wire you are using to connect the outlet to the switch, splice them together by color: Black wires together, white wires together, and all ground wires (including the one in the 3-wire cable) together, all with like-colored pigtails. The amount of protection offered by a surge suppressor is measured in joules. NRTLs such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), Edison Testing Laboratories (ETL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) test appliances to ensure they comply with OSHA's electrical safety rules.</p>
