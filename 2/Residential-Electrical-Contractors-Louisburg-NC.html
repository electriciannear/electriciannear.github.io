    <meta name="description" content="Exhaust Fan Installation Louisburg North Carolina - As defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) , a ''relay'' is "a device that is operated by a variation in the conditions of one electric circuit to affect the operation of other devices in the same or another electric circuit." A ''contactor'', on the other hand, is "a device for repeatedly establishing and interrupting an electric power circuit." It is important to recognize the difference between the two, noting particularly that the relay, serving a secondary role, causes other devices to function, whereas the contactor is the primary unit, doing its work in the main power circuit.">
