The generator's power delivery is sufficient to power whole-house loads, including high-wattage units like electric stoves and air conditioning units.</p>
<p>Like cars, standby generators run nonstop for many hours, so they have to be maintained as if they were, well, cars. Call Mr. Electric for a fuse box upgrade in Lilburn if you are unsure of how to handle wiring and fuse box upgrade procedures.

<p>We can help you get that power with Generac , a trusted name in generators.
