Based on the 2014 requirements and the restrictions in Chapter 9 Tables 11(A) and 11(B), a small and simple low voltage lighting installation, such as those commonly installed under the kitchen cabinets, might require several Class 2 power supplies in order to comply with the code language and stay within the maximum power requirements for a Class 2 power supply.</p>

Pull the plug, not the cord, when disconnecting an electrical device. This flaw can lead to damage to the panel, breakers and home electrical devices, or cause a fire. This can't be understated, it is important to make sure your new generator is installed properly to keep your home appliances working properly and the new generator to last a long time.</p>
