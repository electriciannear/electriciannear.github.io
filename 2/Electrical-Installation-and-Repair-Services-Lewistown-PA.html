While transfer switches for standby power backup systems are usually automatic, you can also get a manual transfer switch for your generator if you so choose.

Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>

Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
