With no wiring, installation is much cheaper than traditional lighting as no concrete or landscaping needs to be torn up and reset and there is no waiting for the utility company to connect the lights.</p>
<p>If you've never inspected your home's electrical wiring, now is the time. Our experienced master electricians will evaluate your company's unique needs to determine the proper number, type, and placement of light fixtures and switches.
