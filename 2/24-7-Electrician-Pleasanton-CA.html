<p>This type of electrical box has fuses that burn out when they become too hot. Also, it has a higher price tag than a gasoline generator costing between $1,900 and $5,000.

<p>Lighting - From outdoor lighting to recessed lighting, Express Electrical Services can help with any lighting project, ensuring that your lighting is installed in a way the functions flawlessly and looks great.
